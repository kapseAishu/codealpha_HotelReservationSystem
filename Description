The Student Grade Tracker is a Java console-based application developed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship. It allows users to input student names and their letter grades (e.g., A, B+, C-), automatically converts them to numeric values, and stores the data using an ArrayList.

The program calculates and displays:
Average grade
Highest grade and corresponding student
Lowest grade and corresponding student
A full student performance report

This project reinforces concepts such as:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Conditional logic and data validation
ArrayLists and class structures
Console input/output handling in Java
